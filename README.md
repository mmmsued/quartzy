# Quartzy


**DESCRIPTION:**
»Quartzy« (quartzy) adds some quartz blocks to Minetest/Luanti. It uses four different patterns called »plain«, »pillar«, »chiseled« and »brick«. Each pattern comes in six different color variations, ranging from »white«, »light_gray«, »gray«, »dark_gray«, »pink« to »dark pink«. This gives you 24 new quartz blocks to build with.  

Not enough? If you install the mod »Circular Saw«, the possibilities are almost endless.
